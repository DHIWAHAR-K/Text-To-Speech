# Text-To-Speech
The Text-to-Speech (TTS) in Python script showcases the implementation of TTS using the gTTS library. Users can input text, and the script converts the text into speech, playing the generated audio. The script serves as a basic guide for integrating TTS functionality into Python projects.
