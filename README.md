# Text-to-Speech (TTS) in Python

## Overview

This Python script demonstrates the implementation of text-to-speech (TTS) using the `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) library. The provided script allows users to input text, and the script converts the text into speech, playing the generated audio. Explore this script to understand the basics of integrating TTS functionality into Python projects.

## Script Components

- **Library Installation:** Installing the `gTTS` library (if not already installed).
- **User Input:** Code for user input to provide text for text-to-speech conversion.
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion:** Utilizing the `gTTS` library to convert the input text into speech.
- **Audio Playback:** Playing the generated audio using the `pygame` library.
- **Output Display:** Displaying messages and notifications for the user.

## Running the Script

1. Install the required libraries by running `pip install gtts pygame` in your Python environment.
2. Open and run the Python script (`text_to_speech.py`) in a Python environment.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to input text for text-to-speech conversion.
4. The script will convert the text into speech and play the generated audio.

## Customization

- Explore other TTS libraries or APIs for different voices or features.
- Modify the script to save the generated audio as a file for later use.
- Adapt the code to include additional features such as language selection or speed adjustment.
